Notes:
-------------

This is a 'real world' test of python frameworks talking to mongodb.

I am not loading any static files (css / js) etc - NgineX can serve them staticly.

I am querying MongoDB and displaying the results as a simply layed out webpage.

MongoDB is run on the same box as the python framework. 

Would have liked to test Gevent on django as well but it is giving me grief.

Data:
------

Included in data-loader/ is a python script that loads London houseprices from Zoopla. This fills mongodb with a load of data which simulates a more 'real world' test



Learned:
-------------

Dont use reg ex in mongo queries they are __slow__

Twisted for webpages is not pretty code.

Async Mongo Drivers are faster than Synchronous Mongo drivers. Although they do not support all the functions that the Synchronous PyMongo driver does.

Django is marginally slower than Twisted/Tornado using async drivers. 

Django is slower when compared against a 'hello world' webpage that does not hit the database.


TODO:
-----------
Run tests with MongoDB on different PC
Test Gevent


Dependencies:
--------------

async-tornado requires Asyncmongo:
Warning: asyncmongo has a dependency on an *old* version of pymongo.

async-twisted requires TxMongo::
